## Description
Ponder is a basic social media app where users can post about whatever topic that interests them. When the user is not logged in, they can see posts and comments on the app. The user may create an account and log in using JWT authentication. This will allow the user to like posts as well as post and comment themselves. Users can also delete their own posts and comments.
